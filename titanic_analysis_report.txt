Titanic Dataset Analysis Report

1. Data Overview

The dataset contains 891 passenger records with demographic, travel, and
survival information across 15 variables. Data types include numerical,
categorical, and boolean values.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Handling Missing Values

-   Age: ~19.9% missing values. These were imputed to preserve important
    information.
-   Embarked / Embark_town: ~0.22% missing values. Kept embark_town
    (town names) for better interpretability. Missing values were
    imputed.
-   Deck: Over 77% missing values. Dropped due to excessive missingness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Removing Redundant Columns

To reduce duplication and improve clarity:
- Dropped pclass (numeric) and kept class (categorical).
- Dropped alive and kept survived as the primary outcome variable.
- Dropped embarked and kept embark_town for readability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Data Distributions and Insights

-   Gender: 577 males, 314 females. Males form the majority of
    passengers.
-   Class: 491 in Third, 216 in First, 184 in Second. Most traveled in
    Third Class.
-   Survival: 342 survived, 549 did not. Majority did not survive.
-   Traveling Alone: 537 traveled alone, 354 traveled with companions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Descriptive Statistics of Numerical Variables

-   Age: Mean ~29 years (range 0.42–80). Most passengers aged 22–35.
-   SibSp: Most had no siblings/spouses aboard; max = 8.
-   Parch: Most had no parents/children aboard; max = 6.
-   Fare: Highly variable (0–512). Outliers are present but retained as
    true values.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Survival Analysis by Groups

-   By Class:
    -   First Class: 136 survived, 80 did not.
    -   Second Class: 87 survived, 97 did not.
    -   Third Class: 119 survived, 372 did not.
        → Survival rate was highest in First Class, lowest in Third
        Class.
        → Represented with pie chart (percentages) and bar chart.
-   By Gender:
    -   Female: 233 survived, 81 did not.
    -   Male: 109 survived, 468 did not.
        → Females had a significantly higher survival rate.
        → Represented with pie chart and bar chart.
-   By Class & Gender:
    -   First: 122 males, 94 females
    -   Second: 108 males, 76 females
    -   Third: 347 males, 144 females
        → Males outnumbered females across all classes, with the largest
        gap in Third Class.
        → Shown with bar chart.
-   By Class & Alone:
    -   First: 109 alone, 107 not alone
    -   Second: 104 alone, 80 not alone
    -   Third: 324 alone, 167 not alone
        → Most Third Class passengers traveled alone.
        → Shown with bar chart.
-   By Class & Embarkation Town:
    -   First: Southampton (127), Cherbourg (85), Queenstown (2)
    -   Second: Southampton (164), Cherbourg (17), Queenstown (3)
    -   Third: Southampton (353), Queenstown (72), Cherbourg (66)
        → Southampton was the dominant embarkation point across classes.
        → Shown with bar chart.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Correlation Analysis

-   Strongest relationship: SibSp and Parch (0.41) → families often
    traveled together.
-   Weak positives: Fare vs. Parch (0.22), Fare vs. SibSp (0.16).
-   Weak negatives: Age vs. SibSp (-0.23), Age vs. Parch (-0.17).
-   Adult_male vs. Parch (-0.35): Adult males were less likely to travel
    with children or parents.
-   Overall, correlations are weak to moderate, indicating that no
    single variable dominates survival prediction.
    → Shown with correlation heatmap.

8. Conclusion

The analysis shows that class, gender, and family status significantly
influenced survival chances. First Class passengers and females had a
much higher chance of survival, while Third Class passengers and males
were least likely to survive. The majority embarked from Southampton,
and many Third Class passengers traveled alone.

The dataset is now cleaned, redundant columns are removed, missing
values are handled, and meaningful insights are supported by both
statistical summaries and visualizations.
